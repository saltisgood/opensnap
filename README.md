OpenSnap
==============
OpenSnap is an alternate Android client for SnapChat that exposes numerous features not available in the default version.

App Download
==============
The app can be downloaded from the [Play Store here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nickstephen.opensnap).

Aims
==============
To provide a more fully featured version of SnapChat that allows for certain restricted options like saving snaps.

Dependencies
==============
OpenSnap has a few module dependencies. 
1. [My Android library](https://github.com/saltisgood/salt-android-library) which is hosted on GitHub. This in turn uses HoloEverywhere, but you can read about that on the other page.
2. [ActionBar-PullToRefresh](https://github.com/chrisbanes/ActionBar-PullToRefresh), also on GitHub. A library for a list with a pull to fresh feature by Chris Banes.
3. The Google Play Services Library. For in-app purchasing.

Other Stuff
==============
Please check out the licence details for what you can and can't do with this source code. I'd encourage you to browse it and learn/ fix what you can but don't try to pass it off as your own work or release it yourself with a different key. You'd make me very sad :(

Contact me through GitHub for any questions about the app or how to use it.
